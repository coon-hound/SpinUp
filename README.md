# VEX Spin Up Code for 2022-23

## Controller Binds

```
Axis 3      Foward/Reverse Drive
Axis 4		Left/Right Drive
Axis 1      Left/Right Turn

Button Y 	Enable Precision Mode
Button X	Disable Precision Mode

Button A	Intake
Button X	Reverse Intake 

Button Up	Flywheel
```

#### TODO
- [x] controller code for drive
- [x] controller code for intake
- [x] controller code for flywheel
- [x] controller code for roller (using intake)
- [x] temperature-based power throttling (unnecessary, remove later)
- [x] Decide on Autonomous round strategy
- [x] Autonomous code finished (not yet tested)
- [x] Updated code structure, putting autonomous functions in bot.h (defined in bot.cpp)
- [ ] Separate intake and shoot functions because the robot may need to move around
- [ ] Potentially need to implement pneumatics

Motor binds in `port_config.h`
